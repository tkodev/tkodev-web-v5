Fast is a feature; the cinematic layer never gets to make the site feel slow.

1. **LCP first.** Fast LCP on desktop and mobile; the first screenful renders without layout shift.
2. **Images lazy-load below the fold.** Decorative image layers (texture backgrounds, thumbnail walls) never block LCP.
3. **Vector geometry ships as optimized SVG** — brand rings, lines, wordmark letterforms — not raster.
4. **The cinematic layer has a budget.** Entry and loading sequences are capped in duration; motion never blocks interactivity or input.
5. **Motion discipline.** Durations, easings, and variants are defined once and imported — no ad-hoc magic numbers per component.
6. **Font loading causes no flash of invisible text and no layout shift** on swap.
